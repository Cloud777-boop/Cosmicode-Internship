I deliberately made my FTP Server vulnerable in order to attack by using metasploit techniques via crafting payload by searching a keyword FTP Payload
These are the passwords lists and ai-based brute-forcer used to attacking my own FTP Server.
I cracked with the desired password list an maintain the access and got the informations by 
command uid, systemid,...etc
